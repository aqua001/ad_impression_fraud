Fraud
Attached is a file with one day of impression logs for selected IP addresses. The fields
are, in order:

Timestamp

Detected browser type
User agent string
Host (URL)
Whether the impression was in view (1.0 = yes, 0.0 = no)
Number of plugins installed
Browser window position and size (x, y, width, height)
Network latency

Your task is to identify hosts which are receiving a substantial amount of fraudulent
traffic. As part of this, you may also wish to identify IP addresses home to machines that
are part of botnets, but this is not required. The definition of "substantial" is up to you --
this may be a ranked list of all hosts, or a list of hosts reaching a certain threshold, or you
may choose not to quantify the amount of fraud and simply classify hosts as likely to be
experiencing high fraud or not. To get you started, here is a list of hosts which are known
to receive substantial amounts of fraudulent traffic:
